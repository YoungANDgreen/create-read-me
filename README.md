# create-read-me

Created a readme file generating terminal application in order for users to quickly generate a ReadMe.md file without having to go through the normal steps.

Application asks 4 simple prompts for users to answer before the file is generated with more in depth questions to be added if necessary.

Lessons learned on this development is that installation of packages and the use of node.js can greatly decrease the time it takes to develop if proper documentation is provided.

Future additions will include the ability to answer several more prompts in order to generate and in depth file building upon the basic file generation currently available.
